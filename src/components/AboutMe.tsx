                Creating things has always been a big part of my life. When I
                was young, I enjoyed building my own lego structures to stories
                during playtime. When I was in highschool, I was deeply enamored
                by music and the creative process behind composition, and the

                This eventually led me to study Computer Science and learn
                software development. Now, I aspire to create
                technology/software to make a difference in the world.
